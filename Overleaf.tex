\chapter{Overleaf Setup}
\label{ch:overleaf}

This chapter describes the configuration of Overleaf, the online LaTeX editor, deployed using Docker.

\section{Docker Setup}

Overleaf was run as a Docker container using the official \texttt{sharelatex/sharelatex} image. The container was started with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
docker run -d --name overleaf \
    --link mongo:mongo \
    --link redis:redis \
    -p 3000:80 sharelatex/sharelatex
\end{verbatim}

This command runs the Overleaf container in detached mode, linking it to MongoDB and Redis containers, and maps port 3000 on the host to port 80 in the container.

\section{Accessing Overleaf}

Once the container is running and linked to the required services, Overleaf can be accessed at:

\begin{center}
\url{http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000}
\end{center}

Replace \url{YOUR_PUBLIC_IP} with the actual public IP address of the machine hosting Docker. Ensure that port 3000 is open and accessible.
